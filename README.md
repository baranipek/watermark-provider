## User Story
A global publishing company that publishes books and journals wants to develop a service to

watermark their documents. Book publications include topics in business, science and media. Journals

donâ€™t include any specific topics. A document (books, journals) has a title, author and a watermark

property. An empty watermark property indicates that the document has not been watermarked yet.

The watermark service has to be asynchronous. For a given content document the service should

return a ticket, which can be used to poll the status of processing. If the watermarking is finished the

document can be retrieved with the ticket. The watermark of a book or a journal is identified by

setting the watermark property of the object. For a book the watermark includes the properties

content, title, author and topic. The journal watermark includes the content, title and author.
